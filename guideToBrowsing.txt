Step 1 : Download the kernel source code and extract it to a directory.
         Find the absolute path to this directory by the following command.
         $pwd
         For representation I will denote the output of this command here as
         <yourPathToKernelSrc>
         Users should replace this with their actual path.
         Eg : In my setup the path is -----> /usr/ksrc/linux-stable/

Step 2 : Download and Install Neccessary Packages
         $sudo apt-get install exuberant-ctags cscope ---> [For Debian Systems]

Step 3 : Verify the correct installation by running the following commands:
         $ctags  --version
         $cscope --version
         If versions are displayed correctly it is a fairly good indication 
         that the installation was successful.

Step 4 : Browse to the kernel source directory
         $cd <yourPathToKernelSrc>

Step 5 : Build the 'tags' file with absolute paths instead of relative paths
         This file is used by ctags to find and resolve symbols.
         This command will take some time to complete and will create a 'tags'
         file in the current directory with a size of few hundred MBs.
         $ctags --file-scope=no -R *
         
Step 6 : Configure vim to add the tags file to its global list so all the
         sub directories can see it.
         $echo ":set tags=<yourPathToKernelSrc/tags>" >> ~/.vimrc
         Eg : In my setup the command resolves into:
              $echo ":set tags=/usr/ksrc/linux-stable/tags" >> ~/.vimrc

Step 7 : You can verify the above step using the following command:
         $cat ~/.vimrc
         You should see that the string we wrote to this file must be present.

Step 8 : Browse to the kernel source directory and run the following command to
         set up cscope database:
         $cscope -R
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note : ctag works from any directory but $cscope -d to open cscope will only 
       work from the location where the cscope.out file is saved.
       To make it globally accessible we have to configure .vimrc file.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Usage --> ctags
---------------
1.To go to definition of a symbol(function, variable) select the symbol with 
  cursor and then press ' CTRL + ]' Keys to jump to symbol definiion

2.To return to calling symbol press 'CTRL + T'

3.To view multiple definitions of a symbol
  Way 1 - Press 'Escape' to enter Vim Command Mode
          Press ':ts' and Enter to see list of available symbols.
          Select the number to jump to that location

  Way 2 - Press 'Escape' to enter Vim Command Mode
          Press g + ] to see list of definitions
          Select the number to jump to that location.

4.:tn -> Next and ':tp' --> previous tags also used in real drivers.

Usage --> cscope
----------------
TODO

Usage - Browsing Files in Same Directory with Vim
-------------------------------------------------
Consider File1, File2, File3 ... FileN in same directory
1. Open File1 in Vim.
2. To switch to the File2 from within Vim use command ':e File2' using 
   TAB completion and press Enter.
3. To return to the previous file press ':e#'

Note : If nested switches are made then Vim saves this information in a 
       numbered buffer. 
       To go to any file 'N' in the buffer use ':e#N'
